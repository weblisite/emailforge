## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Users table (id, email, created_at, updated_at)
- Email accounts table (id, user_id, provider, smtp_host, smtp_port, username, encrypted_password, imap_host, imap_port, is_active)
- Leads table (id, user_id, name, email, company, status, created_at)
- Sequences table (id, user_id, name, description, created_at)
- Sequence steps table (id, sequence_id, step_number, subject, body, delay_days)
- Campaigns table (id, user_id, sequence_id, name, status, created_at, started_at)
- Campaign emails table (id, campaign_id, lead_id, email_account_id, status, sent_at, opened_at, replied_at)

### Key Features to Implement
1. **Email Account Rotation**: Automatically rotate through active email accounts
2. **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits per account (default: 50 emails/hour)
3. **Deliverability Testing**: Pre-send spam score and blacklist checks
4. **Unified Inbox**: Monitor all connected email accounts for replies
5. **CSV Import**: Bulk lead upload with validation
6. **Merge Tags**: Personalization using {{name}}, {{company}}, etc.
7. **Sequence Builder**: Visual interface for creating email sequences
8. **Campaign Analytics**: Track opens, replies, bounces in real-time

### Security Considerations
- Encrypt all email credentials using Fernet
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate all user inputs
- Log all sensitive operations
- Support GDPR compliance features

### Performance Optimizations
- Use connection pooling for database
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Queue long-running tasks (email sending, IMAP polling)
- Use efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Implement pagination for large datasets
